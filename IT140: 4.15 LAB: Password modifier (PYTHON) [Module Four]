#Instructions
Many user-created passwords are simple and easy to guess. Write a program that takes a simple password and makes it stronger by replacing characters using the key below, and by appending "q*s" to the end of the input string.
i becomes !
a becomes @
m becomes M
B becomes 8
o becomes .
Ex: If the input is:
mypassword
the output is:
Myp@ssw.rdq*s
Hint: Python strings are immutable, but support string concatenation. Store and build the stronger password in the given password variable.

#Code Begins
word = input()
password = ''

for character in word:                 
    if character == 'i':               
        word = word.replace('i', '!')
    elif character == 'a':           
        word = word.replace('a', '@')
    elif character == 'm':             
        word = word.replace('m', 'M')
    elif character == 'B':             
        word = word.replace('B', '8')
    elif character == 'o':             
        word = word.replace('o', '.')
else:                                  
    word += 'q*s'
    password = word                    

print(password)
