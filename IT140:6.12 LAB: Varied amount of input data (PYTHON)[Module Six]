#Instructions
Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of integers as input, and outputs the average and max.
Ex: If the input is:
15 20 0 5
the output is:
10 20

#Code Begins
user_input = input()

tokens = user_input.split()  

nums = []                    
for token in tokens:         
    nums.append(int(token))

avg = sum(nums) / len(nums) 
print(int(avg), max(nums))
