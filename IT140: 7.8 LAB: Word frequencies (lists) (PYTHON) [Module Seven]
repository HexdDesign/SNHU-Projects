#Instructions
Write a program that first reads in the name of an input file and then reads the file using the csv.reader() method. The file contains a list of words separated by commas. Your program should output the words and their frequencies (the number of times each word appears in the file) without any duplicates.
Ex: If the input is:
input1.csv
and the contents of input1.csv are:
hello,cat,man,hey,dog,boy,Hello,man,cat,woman,dog,Cat,hey,boy
the output is:
hello 1
cat 2
man 2
hey 2
dog 2
boy 2
Hello 1
woman 1
Cat 1
Note: There is a newline at the end of the output, and input1.csv is available to download.

#Code Begins
import csv

input1 = input()

with open(input1, 'r') as wordsfile:
    words_reader = csv.reader(wordsfile)
    for row in words_reader:
        list_of_words = row

no_duplicates_in_list = list(dict.fromkeys(list_of_words))
listlength = len(no_duplicates_in_list)

for i in range(listlength):
    print(no_duplicates_in_list[i], list_of_words.count(no_duplicates_in_list[i]))
